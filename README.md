## Bibliotheca: Book Review Web Application

Bibliotheca is a user-friendly web application designed to streamline the management of your book collection and enhance your reading experience. With Bibliotheca, you can easily organize your books, write reviews, and keep track of your reading progress.

## Features:

- **View Books:** Bibliotheca provides a visually appealing interface for you to view all your books at a glance. Each book entry showcases its cover image, title, author, and rating, allowing you to quickly identify and access the books you're interested in.

- **Add Books:** Easily add new books to your collection by providing details such as title, author, genres, rating (in stars), review text, and cover image. Bibliotheca ensures that all relevant information about your books is stored in one place, making it convenient to manage your library.

- **Search Books:** Find specific books in your collection effortlessly using keywords or titles. Bibliotheca's search functionality helps you locate desired books quickly, saving you time and effort.

- **Sort and Filter Books:** Customize the way you view your book collection by sorting books based on criteria such as title, author, rating, or publication date.

- **Edit and Delete Books:** Maintain accurate records of your books by editing existing entries to update details or make corrections as needed. If you no longer wish to keep a book in your collection, Bibliotheca allows you to delete books, providing you with the flexibility to manage your library according to your preferences.
